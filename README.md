#*Value of the app for the user:*


This app will be valuable for the user in the sense that he will be able to play a game whenever he wants. It's a simple videogame similar to space invaders. It includes a leaderboard for semi-competitive play and google authentication to keep accounts secure




#*Typical path:*


Upon startup, the user will be asked to authenticate through gmail, the user is then met with a menu screen in which he can join the game. Once in game the user will play until he runs out of lives, or beats the game. Once the game is over the user will be presented with the highscores and an option to play again if possible.










##description of the capstone:


Our capstone is a competitive first-person rogue-like dungeon crawler where one player plays the dungeon master and the other plays the hero. The hero’s job is to navigate the dungeon and kill the dungeon master while acquiring items and upgrades along the way. The dungeon master’s goal is to kill the hero before he is killed himself. Based on the victor of the round, the two players switch roles.
