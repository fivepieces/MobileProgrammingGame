# MobileProgrammingGame
The purpose of our app is to allow spectators to join in on our 2 player game and give them just enough influence to possibly change the outcome of the game. Our app will provide a map of the dungeon that gets updated in real time as the dungeon master creates rooms on the fly. The person who is using the companion app will be able to see when there is an event happening in a room and will be given the option to help the hero or the dungeon master. If he selects the dungeon master the game will spawn in a few extra enemies to help him out, if he selects the hero we will give him a boost in damage or speed.

#*Value of the app for the user:*


It allows the user to interact with the game to change up the normal gameplay that comes with our vanilla game. It gives the user a choice of which player he wants to help if he wants to, otherwise the player can just observe the map and see what is happening in the game.




#*Typical path:*


The user is met with a menu screen in which he can join the game. Once in the game the user can see an overview of the map, there will be rooms that are highlighted in different colours which will indicate there is something happening in the room. The user can click on that part of the map and he will then have the option to help the player of his choice.










##description of the capstone:


Our capstone is a competitive first-person rogue-like dungeon crawler where one player plays the dungeon master and the other plays the hero. The hero’s job is to navigate the dungeon and kill the dungeon master while acquiring items and upgrades along the way. The dungeon master’s goal is to kill the hero before he is killed himself. Based on the victor of the round, the two players switch roles.
